# Welcome to your project's brewer configuration!
# 
# Below is a very brief configuration example of a
# project that contains Coffeescript/LESS source files
# and that should spit out cleanly bundled JS/CSS files
# into './build/{js,css}'.
#
# For more explanations on how that works, and of the
# gazillion ways Brewer.js can make you more productive,
# visit http://www.brewerjs.org
#
# bundler './build',
#   compress: true
#   bundles: []

# coffeescript  './coffee', output: './js'
# less         './less'
